# G5 Experiment: MSC + Multi-Scale Derivatives + Multi-Task Learning

## 🎯 Overview

The **G5 experiment** implements advanced **multi-task deep learning** for simultaneous gender and mortality prediction from hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data of chicken eggs. This experiment combines the proven MSC preprocessing from G1 with enhanced multi-scale derivative features and a sophisticated multi-task neural architecture.

**Key Innovation**: Shared feature extraction with task-specific prediction heads, enabling the model to learn common spectral patterns while capturing task-specific information for both gender and mortality prediction.
