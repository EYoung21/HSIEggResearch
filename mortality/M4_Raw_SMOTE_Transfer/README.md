# M4: Raw + SMOTE + Transfer Learning for Mortality Classification

## Overview

M4 implements a transfer learning approach for mortality classification using raw spectral data with minimal preprocessing. This experiment explores the effectiveness of domain adaptation and feature transfer techniques for hyperspectral imaging-based egg viability prediction.

## Methodology

### Preprocessing Pipeline
1. **Minimal Raw Processing**: Standard normalization of raw spectra (no MSC/SNV/EMSC)
2. **Statistical Feature Extraction**: Mean, std, min, max, median, quartiles, skewness, kurtosis, RMS, energy
3. **Spectral Regional Analysis**: Feature extraction from biological spectral regions (UV, Blue, Green, Red, NIR1, NIR2)
4. **Biologically Meaningful Ratios**: NDVI-like indices, protein/carotenoid ratios
5. **PCA Dimensionality Reduction**: 100 principal components for transfer learning

### Transfer Learning Approach
