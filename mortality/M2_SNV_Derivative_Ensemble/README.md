# M2: SNV + Derivatives + Ensemble for Mortality Classification

## Overview

M2 implements an advanced ensemble learning approach for mortality classification using Standard Normal Variate (SNV) preprocessing combined with derivative features. This experiment demonstrates the power of combining multiple spectroscopic preprocessing techniques with ensemble modeling.

## Methodology

### Preprocessing Pipeline
1. **Standard Normal Variate (SNV)**: Normalizes each spectrum to zero mean and unit variance
2. **Savitzky-Golay Derivatives**: Calculates 1st and 2nd derivatives for enhanced spectral features
3. **Spectral Ratios**: Creates biologically meaningful ratio features from different spectral regions
4. **Statistical Features**: Extracts summary statistics from derivative spectra
5. **Feature Scaling**: Final standardization for optimal model performance

### Machine Learning Models
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble of decision trees with feature importance analysis
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Non-linear classification with RBF kernel
- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting with advanced regularization
- **Voting Ensemble**: Soft voting combination of all three models

### Class Balancing
- **SMOTE-ENN**: Combines synthetic minority oversampling with edited nearest neighbors undersampling
- Addresses mortality class imbalance effectively

## Key Features
