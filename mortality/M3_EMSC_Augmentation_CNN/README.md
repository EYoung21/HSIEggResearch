# M3: EMSC + Augmentation + CNN for Mortality Classification

## Overview

M3 implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** approach for egg mortality classification using **Extended Multiplicative Scatter Correction (EMSC)** preprocessing and advanced **data augmentation** techniques. This experiment represents a significant advancement over traditional machine learning approaches by leveraging deep learning for spectral analysis.

## Methodology

### Preprocessing Pipeline
1. **Extended Multiplicative Scatter Correction (EMSC)**
   - Removes multiplicative and additive scatter effects
   - Uses PCA-based interferent modeling (5 components)
   - Superior to standard MSC for complex spectral variations

2. **Data Augmentation (3x multiplier)**
   - Gaussian noise addition (instrument noise simulation)
   - Spectral shift (±2 wavelengths for calibration variations)
   - Intensity scaling (±5% for illumination variations)
   - Baseline drift (±2% for instrumental drift)
   - Random smoothing (varying window sizes for instrument response)

3. **Multi-scale CNN Feature Engineering**
   - Raw EMSC-corrected spectra
   - Multiple smoothed versions (windows: 5, 11, 21)
   - 1st and 2nd Savitzky-Golay derivatives
   - 6-channel CNN input for comprehensive feature representation
