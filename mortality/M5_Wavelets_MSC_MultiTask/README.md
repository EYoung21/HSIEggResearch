# M5 Experiment: Wavelets + MSC + MultiTask Learning for Mortality Classification

## Overview

The M5 experiment implements an advanced machine learning approach for mortality classification using hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data. This experiment combines wavelet transform preprocessing, multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), and multi-task learning to achieve robust classification performance.

## Methodology

### 1. Preprocessing Pipeline (M5_preprocessing.py)

**Multiplicative Scatter Correction (MSC):**
- Corrects baseline variations and multiplicative effects in spectral data
- Uses mean reference spectrum for normalization
- Applies linear regression-based correction with numerical safeguards

**Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT):**
- Decomposes spectra into multi-resolution components using Daubechies 4 wavelet
- Extracts statistical features from 3 decomposition levels
- Generates 40 wavelet features per spectrum (10 stats × 4 levels)

**Wavelet Reconstruction Features:**
- Low-frequency approximation reconstruction (smooth background)
- High-frequency detail reconstruction (noise/edges)
- 8 additional reconstruction-based features

**Derivative Analysis:**
- 1st and 2nd derivative extraction using Savitzky-Golay filtering
- 10 statistical features from derivative information

**Statistical Feature Extraction:**
- 12 basic statistical measures from processed spectra
- Includes mean, std, min, max, percentiles, variance, peak locations

### 2. Multi-Task Learning Architecture (M5_model.py)

**Primary Task:** Mortality classification (binary: Alive/Dead)

**Auxiliary Tasks:**
- Spectral quality assessment (binary classification)
- Spectral intensity regression (continuous)
- Spectral variance regression (continuous)

**Model Architecture:**
- Shared backbone layers (256 → 128 → 64 neurons)
- Task-specific heads for each prediction task
- Weighted multi-task loss function
- Ensemble with Random Forest and Logistic Regression backup models

### 3. Feature Enhancement

The M5 preprocessing pipeline significantly enhances the feature space:
- **Original:** 300 wavelength features
- **Enhanced:** ~370 advanced features (1.23x enhancement ratio)
- **Types:** MSC-corrected spectra + wavelets + derivatives + statistics

## Results Summary
