# M7: SNV + Mixup + Semi-Supervised Learning for Mortality Classification

## Overview

M7 implements a **semi-supervised learning approach** combining SNV normalization, mixup data augmentation, and ensemble semi-supervised algorithms for embryo mortality classification. This experiment explores how unlabeled data can improve classification performance in hyperspectral egg analysis.

## Methodology

### Preprocessing Pipeline
- **SNV (Standard Normal Variate)**: Individual spectrum normalization to reduce multiplicative scatter effects
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted 370 features from 300 original wavelengths
  - Derivative features (14): 1st and 2nd derivative statistics  
  - Regional features (48): Statistics from 6 spectral regions (blue, green, red, NIR1, NIR2, SWIR)
  - Ratio features (8): Biologically relevant spectral ratios (NDVI-like, water content, etc.)
- **Mixup Augmentation**: Generated synthetic samples by linearly combining existing samples
- **Semi-Supervised Split**: 70% labeled, 30% unlabeled data for semi-supervised learning

### Semi-Supervised Learning Models
- **Label Spreading**: Graph-based transductive learning with k-NN kernel
- **Label Propagation**: Similar to label spreading but with different regularization
- **Self-Training**: Iteratively trains on high-confidence predictions from unlabeled data
- **Ensemble**: Weighted combination based on individual model performance

### Key Innovation: Mixup + Semi-Supervised
- **Mixup augmentation** generated 1,458 synthetic samples (50% of labeled data)
- **Semi-supervised learning** utilized 1,251 unlabeled samples (30% of training data)
- Combined approach leverages both data augmentation and unlabeled information

## Dataset
- **Total samples**: 5,210 mortality cases
- **Training/Test split**: 4,168 / 1,042 (80%/20%)
- **Class distribution**: 4,185 Alive vs 1,025 Dead (≈4:1 ratio)
- **Feature enhancement**: 300 → 370 features (1.23x enhancement)
- **Spectral range**: 374.14 - 1015.32 nm
