CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED
================================================================================
üö® PROBLEM: Model predicts ALL samples as Female

Analysis:
- The model learned to always predict the majority class (Female)
- 53.95% accuracy is misleading - it's just the proportion of females in test set
- No actual learning of discriminative spectral patterns occurred
- This is a classic case of class imbalance leading to poor model performance

Evidence:
- Recall for Male class: 0.00 (no males correctly identified)
- Precision for Male class: 0.00 (no males predicted at all)
- Confusion matrix shows [116, 0] and [99, 0] - all predictions = Female

================================================================================
FEATURE IMPORTANCE ANALYSIS
================================================================================
Top 5 Most Important Wavelengths:
1. 793.2 nm  (importance: 10.91) - Near-infrared, water absorption
2. 631.67 nm (importance: 8.89)  - Red, protein absorption
3. 992.76 nm (importance: 5.98)  - Near-infrared, organic compounds
4. 578.79 nm (importance: 5.90)  - Green-yellow, pigments
5. 443.58 nm (importance: 4.40)  - Blue, carotenoids

Biological Interpretation:
- Near-infrared dominance suggests water/lipid content differences
- Red region importance indicates protein content variations
- Blue region suggests carotenoid/pigment differences
- Pattern indicates potential biological differences exist but model cannot exploit them

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================
üîß IMMEDIATE FIXES:
1. Implement class balancing (SMOTE, class weights in LightGBM)
2. Increase Bayesian optimization calls (30 ‚Üí 100+)
3. Add stratified sampling verification
4. Try different train/test splits

üß™ METHODOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Compare with SNV preprocessing (G2 experiment)
2. Test different algorithms (Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks)
3. Implement ensemble methods
4. Add feature selection to reduce noise
5. Try different derivative orders (2nd derivative)

üî¨ PREPROCESSING ALTERNATIVES:
1. SNV (Standard Normal Variate) instead of MSC
2. EMSC (Extended MSC) for better correction
3. Different Savitzky-Golay parameters
4. Wavelength selection based on biological knowledge

CONCLUSION
================================================================================
‚úÖ SUCCESSFUL PIPELINE: Complete preprocessing and modeling pipeline implemented
‚ùå POOR PERFORMANCE: Model fails to learn discriminative patterns
üîç ROOT CAUSE: Class imbalance and possibly insufficient preprocessing
üéØ NEXT STEPS: Implement class balancing and proceed to G2 experiment for comparison

The G1 experiment serves as a baseline and demonstrates the importance of proper
class handling in machine learning pipelines. The infrastructure is solid and 
ready for systematic comparison with other preprocessing methods.
